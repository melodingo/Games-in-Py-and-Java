# Python Blackjack Game (Still a WIP)

This is a simple command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. It allows you to play the popular card game Blackjack against the computer.

## How to Play

1. Run the `blackjack.py` file.
2. Follow the prompts to play the game.
3. Enter `1` to hit (take another card) or `2` to stand (keep your current hand).
4. Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
5. The computer will also play, and the winner will be determined based on the highest hand without exceeding 21.

## Files
